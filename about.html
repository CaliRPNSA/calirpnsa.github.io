                The NSA has locations and offices all across the state of California, with a main headquarters at postal 9393 on the right side of the map.

            <h1>Partnering</h1>
            <p>
                The NSA partners with multiple departments to provide high-quality case files and to train their agents to be self-sufficient in collecting and storing information. The NSA currently assists the Unites States Marshals with case files in a joint task force code-named 'Cipher'.
